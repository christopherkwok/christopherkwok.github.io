# Christopher Kwok's Personal Website 

Hi, my name is Christopher Kwok and I am currently a recent graduate of UC San Diego's economics program. My interest in becoming a business data analyst grows out of finding new ways to acquire and display data. I am constantly seeking to prove the importance of displaying data both accurately and effectively.

# Personal Data Projects 

## Youtube Reporting API 

In this project, I used **Youtube Reporting API** to request reports of a Youtube content creator account that I was in charge of. In addition to creating a program that calls the reports in **Python**, I compiled the reports and cleaned the data within them to more accurately reflect our target KPIs. In addition, I created a dashboard within **Tableau** and **presentation decks** to display our progress of these metrics to the owner of the content creation account. 

# [Student Coursework](https://github.com/christopherkwok/SQL_coursework) 

This project utlizes a common employees dataset to practice querying data within **MySQL**. I used the relational database structure in tandem with queries to gather information would commonly be used by an organization to gather data such as salaries, managers, start_dates, etc.
