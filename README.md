# Christopher Kwok's Personal Website
  
Hi, my name is Christopher Kwok and I am a data analyst currently looking for a job in the analytics industry.
  
<p> A Business Data Analyst's knowledge in different softwares and data concepts is crucial to conduct their analysis. However, I also believe that the ability to tell a narrative accurately representing the data and communicate these insights to key people, whether management of various departments or shareholders, is equally as important. Without the ability to communicate the significance of the data from your audience' perspective, the real significance of the data becomes lost. I believe my diverse experiences in the finance industry, in the marketing industry, and with people of all different cultures and backgrounds provides me with an ability to communicate with and understand the people I try and reach with my data.  </p>

This project utlizes a common employees dataset to practice querying data within **MySQL**. I used the relational database structure in tandem with queries to gather information would commonly be used by an organization to gather data such as salaries, managers, start_dates, etc.
