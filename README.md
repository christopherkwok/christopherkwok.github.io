# Christopher Kwok's Personal Website 

Hi, my name is Christopher Kwok and I am a recent graduate of UC San Diego's economics program and am currently pursuing a certificate in Business Intelligence Analytics.

<p> A Business Data Analyst's knowledge in different softwares and data concepts is crucial to conduct their analysis. However, I also believe that the ability to tell a narrative accurately representing the data and communicate these insights to key people, whether management of various departments or shareholders, is equally as important. Without the ability to communicate the significance of the data from your audience' perspective, the real significance of the data becomes lost. I believe my diverse experiences in the finance industry, in the marketing industry, and with people of all different cultures and backgrounds provides me with an ability to communicate with and understand the people I try and reach with my data.  </p>

# Personal Data Projects 

## Youtube Reporting API (website in progress)

In this project, I used the **Youtube Reporting API** to request reports of a Youtube content creator account that I was in charge of. In addition to creating a program that calls the reports in **Python**, I compiled the reports and cleaned the data within them to more accurately reflect our target KPIs. In addition, I created a dashboard within **Tableau** and **presentation decks** to display our progress of these metrics to the owner of the content creation account. 

# [Student Coursework](https://github.com/christopherkwok/SQL_coursework) 

This project utlizes a common employees dataset to practice querying data within **MySQL**. I used the relational database structure in tandem with queries to gather information would commonly be used by an organization to gather data such as salaries, managers, start_dates, etc.  

# Makeover Monday

In this series, I take part in Tableau's Makeover Monday challenge, where people redesign visualizations to improve them and show new ways of displaying data in Tableau.
