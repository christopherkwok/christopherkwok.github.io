				<div class="section-text">
					<p> I recently graduated from the University of California, San Diego with a bachelors in Economics and a currently pursing a certificate in Business Intelligence. I am currently looking for full-time employment in Business Data Analytics industry, hoping to use my Data analysis and storytelling skills. </p>
					<p> A Business Data Analyst's knowledge in different softwares and data concepts is crucial to conduct their analysis. However, I also believe that the ability to tell a narrative accurately representing the data and communicate these insights to key people, whether management of various departments or shareholders, is equally as important. Without the ability to communicate the significance of the data from your audience' perspective, the real significance of the data becomes lost. I believe my past experiences working with dancers, videographers, the finance industry, and people of all different cultures and backgrounds provides me with an ability to communicate with and understand the people I try and reach with my data.  </p>
